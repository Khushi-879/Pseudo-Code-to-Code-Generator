# Pseudo-Code-to-Code-Generator
This project builds a **Pseudo Code to Code Generator** using **Lex** and **Bison**, applying parsing techniques to convert high-level pseudo code into C/C++ code. Lex performs tokenization, while Bison handles syntax parsing and code generation based on grammar rules.
